# recipe-app
This recipe-sharing application is served up on React using create-react-app and uses node/express in the backend. React was 
chosen because of its ability to reuse code snippets with components, and node was used for its speed. 
API calls are made with Axios to the Spoonacular API for recipes that users can save to their recipe book. 
Much of this application makes use of the bootstrap grid system and other stylings, such as buttons and input fields.
